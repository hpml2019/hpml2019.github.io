#### *Title*: Scalable and Distributed DNN Training on Modern HPC Systems: Challenges and Solutions

***Speaker*: Dhabaleswar K. (DK) Panda - The Ohio State University**

*Abstract*: This talk will start with an overview of challenges being faced by the AI community to achieve scalable and distributed DNN training on Modern HPC systems. Next, an overview of the emerging HPC technologies will be provided. Next, we will focus on a range of solutions to bring together HPC and Deep Learning together to address the challenges in scalable and distributed DNN training. Solutions along the following directions will be presented: 1) MPI-driven Deep Learning for CPU-based and GPU-based clusters, 2) Co-designing Deep Learning Stacks with High-Performance MPI, 3) Out-of-core DNN training, 4) Accelerating TensorFlow over gRPC on HPC Systems, and 5) Efficient Deep Learning over Big Data Stacks like Spark and Hadoop.

*Short Bio*: DK Panda is a Professor and University Distinguished Scholar of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University. He has published over 450 papers in the area of high-end computing and networking. The MVAPICH2 (High Performance MPI and PGAS over InfiniBand, Omni-Path, iWARP and RoCE) libraries, designed and developed by his research group (<a href="http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu">http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu</a>), are currently being used by more than 3,000 organizations worldwide (in 88 countries). More than 531,000 downloads of this software have taken place from the project's site. This software is empowering several InfiniBand clusters (including the 3rd , 14th , 17th , and 27th ranked ones) in the TOP500 list. The RDMA packages for Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop and Memcached together with OSU HiBD benchmarks from his group (<a href="http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu">http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu</a>) are also publicly available. These libraries are currently being used by more than 305 organizations in 35 countries. More than 29,600 downloads of these libraries have taken place. High-performance and scalable versions of the Caffe and TensorFlow framework are available from <a href="https://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu">https://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu</a>. Prof. Panda is an IEEE Fellow. More details about Prof. Panda are available at <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~panda">http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~panda</a>.
